## Hello! I'm Elham.

I'm a junior studying **Computer Engineering** at the Unversity of Michigan in Ann Arbor, but my home is tethered to Toronto, Canada.

I've been exploring embedded systems, control theory and PCB design among other distractions. I'm especially interested in working on these things in the context of **Aerospace** and **Robotics**.

I'm currently searching for summer (and potentially fall) 2023 internships.

#### Currently, I've been:

- Engineering cool things at [**MIT Lincoln Labs**](https://www.ll.mit.edu/) (remotely after a short yet long summer in Boston)!
- Developing and handling the eletrical/software subsystems on [**MASA: UMich's Rocketry Team**](https://masa.engin.umich.edu/)
- Going through the [**DeepLearning.Ai Specilization**](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/deep-learning-specialization/) after years of procrastination
- Exploring ways to improve exisiting [**methods of solving optimal control problems**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_predictive_control)
- Looking for someone who knows how to play bass guitar
